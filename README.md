# python-3d-math
Computer Graphics Math Library, Vectors, Matrix and so on, everything you need to do Graphics in 3D

The purpose is not to make this blazingly fast, other libraries like opengl could do this better,
but to show and understand the mathematics behind some operations.
Mostly doing in pure python, avoiding numpy.

## base building blocks

Vector Object (4-tuple)
Matrix Object (4 x 4)
